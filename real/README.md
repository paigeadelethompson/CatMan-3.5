# Mr. CatMan's Real Language Model Development 🐱

This is the development environment for training a specialized language model to assist cats with their daily activities and decision-making processes. The model is designed to understand and predict cat behavior, personality traits, and decision-making factors.

## Features

- Custom language model based on GPT-2
- Cat-specific behavior prediction
- Personality trait analysis
- Decision-making assistance
- Multi-task learning approach

## Model Architecture

The model extends GPT-2 with additional prediction heads for:
- Cat behavior categories
- Personality traits
- Decision-making factors

## Training Data

The training data includes:
- Cat behavior scenarios
- Associated behaviors and traits
- Decision-making contexts
- Environmental factors

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Generate training data:
```bash
cd src
python generate_training_data.py
```

3. Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

## Model Configuration

The model can be configured through `configs/model_config.yaml`. Key parameters include:
- Model architecture settings
- Training hyperparameters
- Cat-specific behavior categories
- Personality traits
- Decision-making factors

## Usage

After training, the model can:
- Predict likely cat behaviors in given situations
- Analyze personality traits
- Suggest optimal decisions based on context
- Generate cat-appropriate responses

## Future Improvements

1. Collect real cat behavior data
2. Add support for multi-modal inputs (images, sounds)
3. Implement reinforcement learning from cat feedback
4. Add more sophisticated behavior prediction
5. Integrate with cat monitoring devices
